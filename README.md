<p><strong>What does this utility do?</strong></p>
<p>Every week i get a PDF mailer from CabotWealth.com with 10 recommended stocks. My parser extracts data from this PDF and verifies the stocks&rsquo; rating with two more investing agencies. I get an email with stock ticker and buy price for stocks recommended positively by all three</p>
